## Hello! I'm Xavier ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software developer at Volkswagen Digital Solutions, mainly working with Angular and Java Spring Boot. Iâ€™m always up for exploring new technologies, and right now, Iâ€™m diving into some fun CSS tricks to level up my front-end game.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me solving puzzles or working on my Rubikâ€™s cubes. I love a good challenge, whether it's cracking a tough puzzle or learning something new in tech.

Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me if youâ€™re into coding, puzzles, or anything in between!
