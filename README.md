## Hey! I'm Xavier ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer at Volkswagen Digital Solutions, working with Angular and Java Spring Boot. Lately, Iâ€™ve been having fun exploring crazy stuff that can be done with CSS and just trying to get better at frontend stuff.

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably solving a Rubikâ€™s cube or messing with puzzles. I love learning new things and pushing myself, whether itâ€™s tech or just for fun.

Feel free to check out my repos or hit me up if youâ€™re into coding, puzzles, or just want to chat!
